      <h2>The IPFs copyright chain is a block chain based video copyright protection application. The IPFs copyright chain can effectively protect your original video copyright from plagiarism infringement. If any infringement is found, it is possible to file a copyright appeal at any time to protect its copyright interests.</h2>

1. Fix the security problem of tendermint light client <br/>
2. Fix the security vulnerabilities found in simapp <br/>
3. Fix the security vulnerabilities found in X / bank <br/>
4. Important security fixes for the main chain, as well as some performance improvements<br/>
5. Fix and solve the problem of incorrect handling of the verifier's consensus address<br/>
6. The event emitted by the IBC updateclient message now contains the full header. This change makes header tracking easier and improves the handling of bad behavior<br/>
7. Tendermint has been upgraded to v0.34.8. This version of tendermint introduces various changes, which should make the log much quieter <br/>
8. The keys migrate command is now available for offline, multisignature and ledger keys<br/>
9. Major performance improvements in storage and balancing will accelerate cause validation and initialization<br/>
10. Now, the remaining endpoints are allowed to query transactions using multi signature addresses<br/>
11. The multisign batch command is added, which allows multiple multisign transactions to be generated by merging a batch of signatures<br/>
12. When tendermint submits a new block, versions will update the mapping in iavl mutabletree. If concurrent grpc requests are executed at the same time, it will read the same versions mapping, causing the node to crash. The patch includes routing all grpc requests through abci. Abci's go implementation uses global locking on all requests to linearize them (one at a time), thus preventing concurrent map reading and writing. The X / staging gate will hold the cache map verified by internal validator cache. When multiple grpc queries are executed at the same time, read and write operations to the mapping may occur at the same time, resulting in node crash<br/>
13. Support the amino JSON of IBC msgtransfer <br/>
14. Repair zero time check <br/>
15. Query the upgrade plan when there is no plan for repair<br/>
16. Revise account order <br/> 
17. Protocol buffer migration <br/>
18. IBC support for inter blockchain communication <br/>
19. Update the default history header number of Stargate <br/>
20. Fix the set recall address in X / distribution <br/>
21. Change the number of gentx CMD from flag to Arg <br/>
22. Support IBC upgrade of the same version <br/>
23. Fix the IBC software upgrade proposal that failed automatically, and add the function of unpacking interfaces <br/>
24. Repair the client update proposal decompressor <br/>
25. Fix IBC upgrade, submit and stop logic problems <br/>
26. Fix IBC timeout verification error <br/>
27. Fix the unregistered interface failure when calling get / blocks / latest through rest API <br/>
28. Allow to customize validatedenom for each application<br/>

4. HTTPS / / DNS link name resolution on the subdomain <br/>
5. Update quic library <br/>
6. Secio is disabled by default <br/>
7. Ed25519 secret key is enabled by default <br/>
8. Support for peerid encoded as cidv1 is added for multiple addresses <br/>
9. Support key export and import from IPFs keystore to local. Key file <br/>
10. Plug in version change <br/>
11. Introduce a new secure transmission: libp2p noise <br/>
12. Add support for base36 <br/>
13. Gossip sub protocol upgrade <br/>
14. The introduction of a new "peer-to-peer" function. The peer-to-peer subsystem configures go IPFs to be connected, keeps connected and reconnects to a group of nodes. Nodes should use this subsystem to create "sticky" links between common nodes to improve reliability<br/>

      <h3>Software advantage</h3>
<p>1. The new ecological blockchain service platform provides a more professional and secure blockchain service mode</p>
<p>2. Real and effective way to participate in the provision of simple and effective operation</p>
<p>3. Upload and share your original videos at any time, and issue the copyright certificate for the uploaded works</p>
<p>4. Appeal against the infringement quickly to protect their legitimate rights and interests</p>
<p>5. Decentralized services based on blockchain, IPFs secure storage, no need to worry about data tampering, safe and reliable</p>

      <h3>Function introduction</h3>
<p>1. Copyright publishing, publishing their own original video resources</p>
<p>2. When purchasing resources, users can pay to view the published copyright resources</p>
<p>3. Copyright appeal, if you find that there are infringing resources, you can immediately appeal the copyright of the resources</p>
<p>4. Resource search: search the published copyright resources of the whole network according to the keywords</p>

      
      <h3>Explanation of public test</h3>
      <p>1. During the public beta period, in order to enable users to quickly experience the copyright chain products, 1000fsv will be given automatically after the wallet is created, and it will be recharged to the wallet account in about one minute.</p>
